#* Script Creation - Bash

# Creating a Bash script involves writing a Bash script to a file that can be executed by the Bash
# interpreter. Here are some basic steps to create a script in Bash.

# 1. **Open a Text Editor**:

    # Open a text editor of your choice. You can use text editors in the command line such as `nano`,
    # `vim` or `emacs`, or graphical text editors such as `gedit` or `Notepad++`.

# 2. **Write your Commands**:

    # Write the Bash commands you want to execute in your script. Can include commands, variable
    # declarations, conditional structures, loops, functions, comments, etc Make sure your commands are
    # valid in Bash.

# 3. **Save File**:

    # Save the file with a `.sh` extension to indicate that it is a Bash script. For example, you can
    # name your file `my_script.sh`.

# 4. **Add Execution Permissions**:

    # For the system to allow the script to be executed, you must give it permissions of execution.
    # can do this using the `chmod` command.

    # For example:

    chmod +x my_script.sh

# 5. **Run the Script**:

    # Now you can run the script using `./mi_script.sh` in the line commands. Make sure you are in the
    # correct directory or specify the full path to the file if you don't. found in the same directory
    # as the script.

    # Here is a simple example of a Bash script that displays a message on the screen:

    # This is a comment
    echo "Hello, world!"

# This script displays the message "Hello, world!" on the screen when running. You can customize your
# script to perform more complex tasks and automate processes based on your needs.

# When writing scripts in Bash, keep in mind programming best practices, such as using
# comments to document your code, the organization and readability of the code, and the handling of
# errors appropriate. Additionally, it is important to consider security and permissions when creating and running
# scripts on a system.
