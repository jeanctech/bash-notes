#* Variables and Environments - Bash

# In Bash, variables are containers that store data, values, or strings of characters. Are
# variables can be used to store information, configure program behavior, and
# scripts, and facilitate communication between different parts of a script or program. There's also
# special variables, known as environment variables, that contain information relevant to the
# system environment. Here's an introduction to variables and environments in Bash.

# Variables - Bash

# 1. **Declaring Variables**:

    # You can declare a variable in Bash using the format `variable_name=value`. There should be no spaces
    # around the equal sign (`=`) when declaring variables.

    my_variable="Hello, world"

# 2. **Access to Variables**:

    # To access the value of a variable, use the dollar sign (`$`) followed by of the variable name.

    echo $my_variable

# 3. **Local and Global Variables**:

    # Variables can be local (defined only in a function or script) or global (available throughout the
    # script or program environment). To create a global variable, It is defined outside of a function or
    # script. Local variables are defined within functions or scripts and They are only visible in that
    # context.

# 4. **Read Only Variables**:

    # You can declare a variable as read only using the command `readonly`. A read-only variable cannot be
    # modified after its declaration.

    readonly my_variable="This value cannot be changed"

# 5. **Variables without Value**:

    # You can declare a variable without an initial value. In this case, the variable is considered null
    # or empty.

    empty_variable=

# Environment Variables - Bash

# 1. **Global Environment Variables**:

    # Environment variables are special variables that are available throughout the system. Some common
    # examples of environment variables are `Path` (which specifies the location of executable commands),
    # `Home` (which stores the path to the home directory username) and `User` (which stores the current
    # username).

# 2. **Viewing Environment Variables**:

    # You can view the value of an environment variable using the `echo` command with the dollar sign
    # (`$`) followed by the name of the environment variable.

    echo $Path

# 3. **Setting Environment Variables**:

    # You can set or modify environment variables in Bash using the syntax `variable_name=value`. However,
    # the modifications will only apply to the current environment and will not persist after you log out
    # unless you configure them in configuration files. start as `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.

# 4. **Export Environment Variables**:

    # To make an environment variable available to threads and programs invoked from the current
    # environment, you must export it using the command `export`.

    export My_Variable_in_Environment="Environment variable value"

# 5. **Predefined Environment Variables**:

    # In addition to custom environment variables, Bash includes predefined environment variables, such as
    # `Path`, `Home`, `User`, `Shell`, `Term`, among others. Are Variables are used to configure and
    # customize the behavior of the shell and the programs it supports they run on it.

# Variables and environments in Bash are essential for programming scripts, configuring the
# system and communication between processes. Understanding how to declare, access and set variables is
# essential for writing effective scripts and programs in Bash. Global environment variables are
# particularly important for customizing system and application behavior.
