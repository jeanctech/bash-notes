      # size and modification date.

    cd..
    cd.

    # - If you don't provide a path, `cd` will take you to the current user's home directory.

# 4. **Relative and Absolute Paths**:

    # - Relative paths are based on the current location and specify the location of a file or
    # directory with respect to the current location. For example, `../directory` refers to a directory
    # called "directory" in the parent directory.
