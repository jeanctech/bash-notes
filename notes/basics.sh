#* Basics - Bash

# Bash, short for "Bourne-Again Shell", is a command interpreter and scripting language that is
# commonly used on Unix and Linux systems. Here are some basics about Bash.

# 1. **Shell**:

    # The shell is a command line interface that allows users to interact with the
    # Os. Bash is one of the most popular shells and is used to write and execute commands
    # on a Unix/Linux system.

# 2. **Commands**:

    # Commands are specific instructions that are executed in the shell. Bash includes a
    # wide variety of built-in commands and also supports the execution of external programs.

# 3. **Prompt**:

    # The prompt is the signal that the shell shows to indicate that it is ready to receive
    # a command. The prompt usually displays information such as the username, hostname, and
    # current route.

# 4. **Arguments**:

    # Arguments are values or text strings that are passed to a command or script. By For example,
    # `ls -l` has an argument `-l`.

# 5. **Variables**:

    # Variables in Bash store data that can be used in scripts and commands. You can assign values to
    # variables and retrieve them using the `$` sign. Example: `my_variable="Hello World"` and then `echo
    # $my_variable`.

# 6. **Wildcards**:

    # Wildcards are special characters, such as `*` and `?`, that are used to match multiple files or
    # directories in one command. For example, `*.txt` would match all files with ".txt" extension.

# 7. **Redirection**:

    # Redirection in Bash allows you to redirect the standard input and output of a command.
    # For example, `>` is used to redirect the output of a command to a file, and `<` is used to
    # redirect input from a file.

# 8. **Pipes**:

    # Pipes allow you to combine the output of one command with the input of another.
    # For example, `command1 | command2` will send the output of `command1` as input to `command2`.

# 9. **Scripts**:

    # A Bash script is a file that contains a sequence of commands and is executed in the
    # shell. Bash scripts allow you to automate tasks and perform more complex operations.

# 10. **Comments**:

    # You can add comments in a script or command line using the `#` symbol. Comments are ignored by the
    # Bash interpreter.

# 11. **Control Structures**:

    # Bash supports control structures such as `if`, `for`, `while`, `case`, that allow you to make
    # decisions and perform repetitions in your scripts.

# 12. **Environment Variables**:

    # Bash uses environment variables to store global information of the system and to customize the
    # behavior of the shell. You can view and modify environment variables using commands like `export`
    # and `echo`.

# 13. **Command History**:

    # Bash stores a history of previously executed commands, which makes it easy to recover and reexecute
    # previous commands.

# 14. **Internal and External Commands**:

    # Bash includes internal commands that are built into the shell and external commands that are
    # independent programs. Internal commands are usually faster, since They do not require a system call.

# These are basics to help you get started with Bash. Bash is a tool powerful for system administration,
# task automation and scripting in Unix and Linux systems.
