#? Introduction - Bash

# Bash, short for "Bourne-Again Shell", is a command interpreter and scripting language
# widely used in Unix and Linux operating systems. It is a fundamental part of most
# Linux distributions and is also found on macOS. Bash provides a line interface
# commands that allow users to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks,
# from executing simple commands to automating complex tasks.

#? Here's an introduction to key Bash concepts:

#* 1. **Command Line Interface (Cli)**:

    # Bash is a command line interface that allows users to Users send instructions to the operating
    # system by typing commands in a terminal window.

#* 2. **Commands**:

    # Commands are instructions that are executed in Bash. Commands can be programs executables or
    # internal Bash commands.

#* 3. **Command Syntax**:

    # Commands generally have the following syntax: `command [options] [arguments]`. Options are indicated
    # by flags (for example, `-l`), and arguments are data that the command needs to perform a specific
    # task.

#* 4. **Internal and External Commands**:

    # Bash includes both internal commands and external commands. The internal commands are part of the
    # Bash interpreter itself and run faster, while External commands are independent programs.

#* 5. **Variables**:

    # You can define and use variables to store data in Bash. The variables are assigned and retrieved
    # using the `$` sign. For example, `my_variable="Hello"` and then `echo $my_variable` shows "Hello."

#* 6. **Redirection**:

    # Bash allows you to redirect the standard input and output of a command. For example, `>`
    # is used to redirect output to a file, and `<` is used to redirect input from a archive.

#* 7. **Pipes**:

    # You can combine commands using pipes to pass the output of a command as entry to another. For
    # example, `command1 | command2` executes `command1` and uses its output as entry for `command2`.

#* 8. **Task Automation**:

    # Bash is widely used for task automation. Can write Bash scripts that execute a series of commands in
    # sequence to perform repetitive tasks or complex.

#* 9. **Environment Variables**:

    # Bash uses environment variables to store global information of the system and configure the shell
    # behavior. You can define and modify environment variables to Personalize your work environment.

#* 10. **Command History**:

    # Bash maintains a history of commands executed, making it easier to recovery and reexecution of
    # previous commands.

# Bash is a powerful tool for managing Unix and Linux systems, performing administration tasks,
# automate workflows and schedule custom scripts. As you become more familiar with Bash,
# You will be able to perform more advanced and efficient tasks on the command line.
